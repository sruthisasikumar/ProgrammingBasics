#### What are computer programs?
Computers can only perform operations that are instructed to them. Computers
do not understand English language. They understand only machine language or
binary language, which is a series of 1's and 0's.
So, computer programming languages were developed that are used to write the
instructions for the computer in an English based language that can be 
converted to computer-understandable language.

Computer programs are the set of instructions for the computer to 
perform any specific function, in a programming language.


#### Basic Programming Concept:
There are many programming languages that have been developed over the years, 
such as C, C++, Java, Perl, Python, Scala, and so on. Regardless of the 
programming language used the three basic concepts of programming are:

1. Sequence of Commands:
The programs should always be written such as the right commands are given in 
the right order.
For example, if we require to goto a shop to buy a 4-line note book. Then
the sequence can be stated as first we go to the stationary shop. Go to the 
note book section, check each note book until we find the 4-line book. Pay for
the book and return home.
If we pay first and then select the book, then there can be a difference in 
price which is confusing.
Similarly all actions have a sequence in which it is to be executed. We have 
to carefully give the sequence to the computer as the computer will not be able 
to understand on its own if we the actions are performed in the wrong order.

2. Conditional Statements:
Conditional statements refer to the "if....else" situations where we have to 
make a choice.
In the above example, the checking of the book to confirm whether it is a 
4-line note is a condition statement. We take the first book, "if" it is a 
4-line book, we goto pay the cash.Else to move to the next book and continue 
searching.

3. Looping Structures:
Looping structures are required to repeat the process a number of times until
a certain condition becomes true and the control exits the loop.
In the above example, each time the book examined is not a 4-line note book,the
process of selecting a book and checking if its 4-line is repeated.


#### Algorithms and Flowcharts:

Programs are developed to find solutions for some identified problem. We can 
generally say the steps in programming as:
1. Defining the problem
2. Planning the solution
3. Coding the program
4. Testing the program
5. Documenting the program.

Algorithms and flowcharts are neede in the planning of the solutions. They 
explain the process of a program. 

``` 
An algorithm is a logical step-by-step method to solve the problem.
```

```
A flowchart is the graphical or pictorial representation of an algorithm with
the help of symbols, shapes and arrows  to demonstrate a process or the 
program.
```

The standard symbols used in flowcharts:

1. Oval - Start/Stop Box
2. Parallelogram - Input/Output
3. Rectangle - Process
4. Diamond - Decision
5. Connector/Arrow - flow of the program.

Example 1: Read two sides of a rectangle and print its area

Algorithm:
Step1: Input W,L
Step2: Calculate A<-(W*L)
Step3: Print A

Example 2: To print from 1 to 20

Algorithm:
Step1: Initialize X as 0
Step2: Increment X by 1, X<-X+1
Step3: Print X
Step4:  If (X<20) then goto Step 2


Example 3:Calculate average marks of a student in 4 subjects and indicate whether
it is passing or failing.

Algorithm:
Step1: Input N1,N2,N3,N4
Step2: Calculate Avg<-(N1+N2+N3+N4)/4
Step3: Print Avg
Step4: If (Avg >50) then
         Print "Pass"
       else
         Print "Fail"
       endif
